# Prescription PDF Generation Feature

## Overview
This feature automatically generates professional, branded PDF prescriptions for doctors in the CureConnect platform. Instead of requiring doctors to manually upload PDF files, the system now creates a well-formatted prescription document using the information entered in the prescription form.

## How It Works

1. When a doctor creates or updates a prescription, the system collects all the relevant information:
   - Patient details
   - Doctor information
   - Appointment details
   - Medications (name, dosage, frequency, duration)
   - Notes

2. The `generatePrescriptionPDF` utility function uses jsPDF to create a professionally formatted PDF with:
   - CureConnect branding and header
   - Doctor and patient information
   - Appointment date
   - Medications in a tabular format
   - Doctor's notes
   - Doctor's signature
   - Footer with legal text

3. The generated PDF is automatically attached to the prescription record and stored on the server.

4. Patients and doctors can download the prescription PDF through the existing download functionality.
